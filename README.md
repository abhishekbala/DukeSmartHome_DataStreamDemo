Duke University Smart Home Data Toolkit
======================================
This project provides a toolkit to disaggregate and detect anomalies in energy data. The specific modules of this toolkit are:
  1. Live data streaming and storage of smart meter data (from a MySQL database) and local temperature data (from online sources)
  2. Event detection and classification
  3. Energy forecasting and anomaly detection

Currently the toolkit is focused on working with the Duke University Smart Home. Details of this smart home can be found here: http://smarthome.duke.edu/
